In this paper, we have presented a counter-example generation mechanism for the
PBEC reported in~\cite{Chouksey18}.  A similar counter-example generation
mechanism can also be developed for other reported equivalence checking methods
as well. The idea is to reuse the equivalence information of a PBEC 
to generate a counter-trace efficiently and then use CBMC to generate
a counter-example. We have also shown that a path-based equivalence
checking method can be further strengthened with the counter-example generation
mechanism. As shown in the experiments, the EVP method can take stronger equivalence
decision with help of counter-examples. Our counter-example generation mechanism
identifies a false negative result of the EVP method. In the future, we plan to
enhance the EVP method to handle the `proceed further' (i.e., false
negative cases) scenarios identified by our counter-example generation
mechanism.
