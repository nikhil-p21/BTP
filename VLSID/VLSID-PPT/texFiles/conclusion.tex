\begin{frame}{Conclusion \& Future Works}
\begin{itemize}
\item Proposed a CEG mechanism for the PBEC.
\item PBEC is further strengthened with the CEG mechanism.
\item For some scenarios PBEC reports not equivalent and provide CE as a proof.
\item Identified a false negative result of the EVP method.
\item Similar CEG mechanism can also be developed for other reported equivalence checking methods as well.
\item Enhance the EVP to handle false negative cases.
\end{itemize}
